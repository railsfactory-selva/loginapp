= health_check

Simple health check of Rails app for use with uptime.openacs.org or wasitup.com

The basic goal is to check that rails is being launched and that it has access to correctly configured resources (database, email gateway)

The email gateway is not checked unless the smtp settings have been changed,
specify full or include email in the list of checks or varify the smtp settings
(eg use 127.0.0.1 instead of localhost). 

health_check provides various monitoring URIs 

    % curl localhost:3000/health_check
    success

    % curl localhost:3000/health_check/standard
    success

    % curl localhost:3000/health_check/all
    success

    % curl localhost:3000/health_check/site_and_database_and_email_migrations
    success

== Uptime Monitoring

See
* [WasItUp](http://wasitup.com/)
* [Uptime by OpenACS](http://uptime.openacs.org/uptime/)
* [Engine Yard's guide](http://community-support.engineyard.com/faqs/guides/uptime-monitoring-for-your-rails-application) guide based on fitter_happier plugin includes monit and other setup help

== Checks

* standard (default) - site, database and migrations checks are run plus email if settings have been changed
* all / full - all checks are run
* database - checks that the database contains the current migration level
* email - basic check of email - :test returns true, :sendmail checks file is present and executable, :smtp sends HELO command to server and checks response 
* migration - checks that the database migration level matches that in db/migrations
* site - checks rails is running sufficiently to render text 

== Note on Patches/Pull Requests
 
* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a
  future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history.
  (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.

== Known Issues 

* Rails 1.x s not currently supported (smtp_settings versus server_settings)
* I wasn't able to get tests to work standalone - the gem has to be installed as a plugin for the tests to work
* No inline documentation for methods

* Feedback welcome especially with suggested replacement code and corresponding tests

== Similar projects

* fitter_happier plugin by atmos - plugin with similar goals, but not compatible with uptime, and does not check email gateway
